## Express Structure

This code is a simple Node.js application using the Express framework to serve static files and a single HTML page. Let's break it down and add comments:

```javascript
// Importing the express module
import express from 'express';

// Importing the resolve function from the path module to handle file paths
import { resolve } from 'path';

// Creating an instance of the Express application
const app = express();

// Specifying the port number
const port = 3010;

// Serving static files from the 'static' directory
app.use(express.static('static'));

// Handling GET requests to the root URL '/'
app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  // Sending the 'index.html' file located in the 'pages' directory
  res.sendFile(resolve(__dirname, 'pages/index.html'));
});

// Listening on the specified port
app.listen(port, () => {
  // Logging a message to indicate that the server is running
  console.log(`Example app listening at http://localhost:${port}`);
});
```

Explanation:

1. We import the `express` module and the `resolve` function from the `path` module. Express is a web application framework for Node.js, and `resolve` is used to resolve file paths.

2. We create an instance of the Express application using `express()` and assign it to the variable `app`.

3. We specify the port number `3010` on which the server will listen for incoming requests.

4. The `app.use(express.static('static'))` line tells Express to serve static files from the 'static' directory. This means that files like CSS, JavaScript, and images stored in the 'static' directory can be accessed by clients.

5. We define a route for handling GET requests to the root URL `'/'`. When a GET request is made to the root URL, the callback function `(req, res)` is executed. This function sends the 'index.html' file located in the 'pages' directory back to the client using the `res.sendFile()` method. The `resolve(__dirname, 'pages/index.html')` function generates the absolute path to the 'index.html' file.

6. Finally, we call the `app.listen()` method to start the Express server. It listens on the specified port (`3010`), and once the server is running, it logs a message to the console indicating that the server is listening at the specified URL.

## Express Essential request and response Properties

These index numbers should help in referencing specific properties and methods easily.

## Express Middlewares

```javascript
// Middleware to parse incoming requests with JSON payloads and limit the payload size to 16kb
app.use(express.json({ limit: "16kb" }));

// Middleware to parse incoming requests with URL-encoded payloads and limit the payload size to 16kb
app.use(express.urlencoded({ extended: true, limit: "16kb" }));

// Middleware to serve static files from the "public" directory or save data in a separate file for later use
app.use(express.static("public"));

// Middleware to parse cookies from incoming requests
app.use(cookieParser());
```

Explanation with comments:
1. The first middleware (`express.json({ limit: "16kb" })`) is used to parse incoming requests with JSON payloads. It ensures that the server can parse JSON data sent in the request body. Additionally, the `{ limit: "16kb" }` option specifies the maximum size of the JSON payload to be 16kb. This prevents large payloads from consuming excessive server resources or causing denial-of-service (DoS) attacks.

2. The second middleware (`express.urlencoded({ extended: true, limit: "16kb" })`) is used to parse incoming requests with URL-encoded payloads. This middleware parses data encoded in the URL-encoded format (e.g., form data sent from an HTML form). The `{ extended: true }` option allows parsing of nested objects, while the `{ limit: "16kb" }` option sets the maximum size of the payload to 16kb, similar to the JSON middleware.

3. The third middleware (`express.static("public")`) serves static files (e.g., HTML, CSS, JavaScript) from the specified directory ("public"). This middleware allows the server to serve static files directly to clients without requiring additional routing or processing.

4. The fourth middleware (`cookieParser()`) parses cookies from incoming requests. It extracts cookies sent by clients and makes them available in the `req.cookies` object for further processing by the application.

**Necessity:**
- Whether to include these middleware in your code depends on the requirements of your application.
- If your application needs to handle JSON or URL-encoded data, serve static files(save data in a separate file for later use), or parse cookies, then including these middleware is necessary.
- The options provided (e.g., payload size limit) may also be adjusted based on your application's requirements and security considerations.
- Including these middleware helps in handling common tasks efficiently and improves the overall functionality and security of the application.


## Express's error-handling Middleware

```javascript
// Define a higher-order function named asyncHandler
const asyncHandler = (requestHandler) => {
    // Return a function that takes req, res, and next as parameters
    return (req, res, next) => {
        // Wrap the requestHandler in a Promise and resolve it
        Promise.resolve(requestHandler(req, res, next))
            // If the Promise resolves successfully, do nothing
            .catch((err) => next(err)); // If the Promise rejects (throws an error), pass the error to the next middleware
    };
};

// Export the asyncHandler function for use in other modules
export { asyncHandler };
```

Explanation with comments:
1. The `asyncHandler` function is a higher-order function that takes a `requestHandler` function as its parameter.
2. Inside `asyncHandler`, it returns another function that takes `req`, `res`, and `next` as its parameters. This returned function acts as middleware.
3. Within the returned function:
   - The `requestHandler` function is called with `req`, `res`, and `next` parameters.
   - The result of `requestHandler` is wrapped in a Promise using `Promise.resolve()`.
   - If the Promise resolves successfully (i.e., the `requestHandler` function completes without throwing an error), nothing happens.
   - If the Promise rejects (i.e., the `requestHandler` function throws an error), the error is passed to the `next` middleware using `next(err)`.
4. This pattern allows asynchronous request handlers to handle errors gracefully. Instead of using try-catch blocks within each route handler, the `asyncHandler` middleware can be used to catch errors and pass them to Express's error-handling middleware (`next(err)`).
5. Exporting the `asyncHandler` function allows other modules to use it for handling asynchronous route handlers without repetitive error handling code.

In summary, the `asyncHandler` function simplifies error handling in asynchronous route handlers by wrapping them in a Promise and passing any errors to Express's error-handling Middleware.

## Mongoose Structure

This code is defining a Mongoose schema and model for a Todo item in a MongoDB database. Let's add comments to explain it:

```javascript
// Importing the mongoose library for MongoDB object modeling
import mongoose from 'mongoose';

// Defining a Mongoose schema for SubTodo items
const subTodoSchema = new mongoose.Schema(
  {
    content: {
      type: String,
      required: true,
    },
    complete: {
      type: Boolean,
      default: false,
    },
    // Referencing User schema to get the user details
    createdBy: {
      type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId,
      ref: 'User',
    },
  },
  { timestamps: true }
);

export const SubTodo = mongoose.model('SubTodo', subTodoSchema);
// The second argument { timestamps: true } enables automatic timestamp for each document.
// This means that Mongoose will automatically manage two fields in each document:
// createdAt: The timestamp when the document was created.
// updatedAt: The timestamp when the document was last updated.

// Creating a Mongoose model for the Todo schema
export const Todo = mongoose.model('Todo', TodoSchema);
// The mongoose.model() function creates a new model called 'Todo' based on the TodoSchema.
// This model will be used to perform CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on Todo items.
// By exporting the model, it can be imported and used in other parts of the application.
```

Explanation:

1. We import the `mongoose` library, which is a popular MongoDB object modeling tool designed to work in an asynchronous environment.

2. We define a Mongoose schema using `mongoose.Schema()`. In this case, an empty object `{}` is passed as the first argument to indicate that the schema has no specific fields defined. The second argument `{ timestamps: true }` enables automatic timestamping for each document created using this schema.

3. The `timestamps: true` option tells Mongoose to automatically manage two special fields in each document: `createdAt` and `updatedAt`. These fields will contain timestamps indicating when the document was created and last updated, respectively.

4. We create a Mongoose model named 'Todo' using `mongoose.model()`. This model is associated with the TodoSchema we defined earlier. The model provides an interface for interacting with MongoDB to perform operations such as creating, reading, updating, and deleting Todo items.

5. Finally, we export the Todo model using `export const Todo = mongoose.model('Todo', TodoSchema);` so that it can be imported and used in other files within the application. This allows other parts of the application to interact with the Todo model and perform database operations on Todo items.

## Mongoose Fields Structure

In Mongoose, you can define various types of fields in a schema to represent the structure of documents in a MongoDB collection. Here are the common types of fields that can be defined in a Mongoose schema:

1. **String**: Used to represent text or string data.
   
   ```javascript
   const schema = new mongoose.Schema({
     name: String,
     email: {
       type: String,
       required: true
     }
   });
   ```

2. **Number**: Represents numeric data, both integers and floating-point numbers.
   
   ```javascript
   const schema = new mongoose.Schema({
     age: Number,
     price: {
       type: Number,
       required: true
     }
   });
   ```

3. **Date**: Used to represent date and time values.
   
   ```javascript
   const schema = new mongoose.Schema({
     createdAt: Date,
     updatedAt: {
       type: Date,
       default: Date.now
     }
   });
   ```

4. **Boolean**: Represents boolean values (true/false).
   
   ```javascript
   const schema = new mongoose.Schema({
     isActive: Boolean,
     isDeleted: {
       type: Boolean,
       default: false
     }
   });
   ```

5. **Object**: Represents embedded objects or sub-documents.
   
   ```javascript
   const schema = new mongoose.Schema({
     address: {
       street: String,
       city: String,
       zip: Number
     }
   });
   ```

6. **Array**: Represents arrays of values or sub-documents.
   
   ```javascript
   const schema = new mongoose.Schema({
     tags: [String],
     tasks: [{
       title: String,
       completed: Boolean
     }]
   });
   ```

7. **Mixed**: Represents any arbitrary data structure. It can contain any type of data.
   
   ```javascript
   const schema = new mongoose.Schema({
     data: mongoose.Schema.Types.Mixed
   });
   ```

8. **ObjectId / References**: Used to establish relationships between documents in different collections. This is used for defining foreign keys.
   
   ```javascript
   const schema = new mongoose.Schema({
     author: {
       type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId,
       ref: 'User'
     }
   });
   ```

9. **Map**: Represents key-value pairs where the keys can be of any data type.
   
   ```javascript
   const schema = new mongoose.Schema({
     ratings: {
       type: Map,
       of: Number
     }
   });
   ```

These are the main types of fields you can define in a Mongoose schema. Additionally, you can use various schema options and modifiers to further customize the behavior and validation of fields in the schema.

## Mongoose Field Properties


In Mongoose schemas, you can define various properties and options for fields to control their behavior, validation, and default values. Here are some common properties and options that can be given to a field in a Mongoose schema:

| Property           | Description                                                                                     |
|--------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| type               | Specifies the data type of the field.                                                          |
| required           | Specifies whether the field is required or not.                                                 |
| default            | Defines a default value for the field.                                                          |
| enum               | Restricts the field to only accept values from a predefined set of options.                     |
| min                | Sets the minimum value for numeric fields (Number, Date).                                       |
| max                | Sets the maximum value for numeric fields (Number, Date).                                       |
| validate           | Allows custom validation logic to be defined for the field.                                      |
| unique             | Specifies that the field value must be unique across all documents in the collection.           |
| trim               | Removes leading and trailing whitespace from string values.                                      |
| lowercase          | Converts string values to lowercase.                                                            |
| uppercase          | Converts string values to uppercase.                                                            |
| sparse             | Allows sparse indexing for the field, meaning that documents without the field are not included in the index. |
| index              | Specifies whether to create an index for the field.                                              |
| ref                | Specifies the model to which the field is referring in case of ObjectId fields.                  |
| select             | Specifies whether the field should be included or excluded by default when querying documents.   |
| immutable          | Specifies that the field is immutable, meaning its value cannot be changed after the document is created. |
| validateBeforeSave | Specifies whether to perform schema-level validation before saving the document to the database. |

This table provides a summary of properties and options that can be used in a Mongoose schema to define fields.


## Backend FileStructure and Functionality

Sure! Here's a visual representation of the backend file structure:

```js
/backend
│
├── controllers
│   ├── UserController.js
│   ├── FormController.js
│   └── ...
│
├── db
│   ├── dbConfig.js
│   ├── migrations
│   │   ├── migration1.js
│   │   ├── migration2.js
│   │   └── ...
│   └── seeds
│       ├── seed1.js
│       ├── seed2.js
│       └── ...
│
├── middlewares
│   ├── authMiddleware.js
│   ├── validationMiddleware.js
│   └── ...

│
├── utils
│   ├── validationUtils.js
│   ├── errorUtils.js
│   └── ...
│
├── app.js
├── constants.js
└── index.js
```

This structure organizes the backend codebase into separate folders based on their functionalities, such as controllers, database-related files, middleware, models, routes, utils, and main application files (app.js, constants.js, index.js). Each folder contains relevant modules or files, promoting a clear separation of concerns and making it easier to manage and maintain the codebase.

Each of these folders plays a specific role in structuring and organizing a Node.js project, especially when it follows the MVC (Model-View-Controller) pattern. Let's go through each folder:

1. **controllers**:
   - Functionality: This folder typically contains modules that define the logic to handle HTTP requests and responses. Controllers interact with models to fetch or manipulate data and then send the appropriate response back to the client.
   - Need: Separating controller logic from route definitions helps keep the codebase organized and makes it easier to maintain and test.

2. **db**:
   - Functionality: This folder may contain database-related files, such as database connection configuration, database initialization scripts, or database migration files.
   - Need: Centralizing database-related code in one folder helps maintain a clear separation of concerns and makes it easier to manage database-related tasks across the application.

3. **middlewares**:
   - Functionality: Middleware functions are functions that have access to the request object (req), the response object (res), and the next middleware function in the application's request-response cycle. They can perform tasks such as logging, authentication, authorization, input validation, etc.
   - Need: Middleware functions help modularize and encapsulate common request-processing logic, making it reusable across different routes or controllers.

4. **models**:
   - Functionality: This folder typically contains modules that define the structure of data objects (models) and interact with the database to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations. Each model represents a collection/table in the database.
   - Need: Models provide an abstraction layer that separates the application logic from the underlying database implementation. They encapsulate data access and manipulation logic, promoting code reusability and maintainability.

5. **routes**:
   - Functionality: This folder contains modules that define the application's API routes. Each route module typically maps HTTP request methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to corresponding controller functions.
   - Need: Separating route definitions from controller logic helps maintain a clear separation of concerns and makes it easier to organize and manage API endpoints.

6. **utils**:
   - Functionality: This folder may contain utility modules that provide commonly used functions or helper functions across the application. Utilities can include functions for data validation, formatting, error handling, etc.
   - Need: Centralizing utility functions in one folder promotes code reuse and maintainability. It also helps avoid code duplication by providing a common place to store and access utility functions.

7. **app.js**:
   - Functionality: This file typically serves as the entry point of the application. It initializes the Express application, sets up middleware, defines routes, and starts the server.
   - Need: The app.js file orchestrates the setup and configuration of the entire application, providing a single entry point for developers to understand and modify the application's behavior.

8. **constants.js**:
   - Functionality: This file may define constants used across the application, such as API endpoints, error messages, configuration settings, etc.
